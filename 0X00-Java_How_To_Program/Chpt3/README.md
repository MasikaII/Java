# Introduction To Classes, Objects, Methods, and Strings.
Concepts covered:
- Creating user defined classes and methods.
- Creating objects of user defined classes and calling methods of these objects to perform useful actions.
- Declaring instance variables of a class to maintain data for each object of the class and declaring user defined methods to operate on the data.
- Calling a method and telling it to perform its task and how to pass information to a method as arguments whose values are assigned to the method's parameters.
- Difference between a local variable of a method and an instance variable of a class. (only instance variables are initialized automatically)
- How to use a class's constructor to specify the initial values for an object's instance variables.
- How to create UML class diagrams
- Floating-point numbers: how to store them with variables of primitive type double, how to input them with a Scanner object and how to format them woth printf and format specifier %f for display purposes.
