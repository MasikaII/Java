# Control Statements: Part 1; Assignment, ++, and -- Operators
Concepts covered:
- Problem solving for building classes and developing methods for these classes
- Algorithm construction: 
    - Refinement of algorithms through several phases of pseudocode development, 
    resulting in a code that can be executed as part of a method.
    - Use of top-down, stepwise refinement to plan out the specific actions that a method
    must perform and the order in which the method must perform these actions.
- Control structures / statements: sequence, selection, repetition
- Control statement stacking
- Control statement nesting
- Compound assignment operators
- Increment and decrement operators
- Primitive Types
